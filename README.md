# Helpdesk hybrid application
I was tasked to build this application using Angular and ionic framework during my internship.
The duration of the task was 1 week, and i had to learn how to use both tools from scratch.

## Requirements
[NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installation
Clone the repository to a local folder, then open cmd in that folder.

Note: close your browser before continuing, to avoid connection errors in console.

In cmd, type and run ```npm install all``` to install dependencies.

## Usage
After the installation phase, type and run ```npm start``` or ```ng serve``` in cmd to run the project.
A browser window should now be open with the application loaded and at your service.

## Project Status
Optimized front-end layout and functionality, currently storing data on localstorage.
